## Features

- **Brute-force Attacks**: AuthCrack can perform brute-force login attempts on various web applications.
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Use predefined wordlists to crack passwords efficiently.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust parameters like timeout and retries to suit your needs.
- **Multi-threading**: Speed up the cracking process by running multiple threads.
- **Logging**: Keep track of attempts and results for further analysis.

## Installation

To get started with AuthCrack, you need to clone the repository and install the required packages.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fadimvp/AuthCrack-v8.git
   cd AuthCrack-v8
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run AuthCrack, you need to execute the main script with the appropriate parameters. Here‚Äôs a basic command structure:

```bash
python authcrack.py --url <target_url> --username <username> --wordlist <path_to_wordlist>
```

### Example

```bash
python authcrack.py --url http://example.com/login --username admin --wordlist /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

For more detailed options, check the help command:

```bash
python authcrack.py --help
```

## How It Works

AuthCrack operates by sending multiple login requests to the target URL. It uses either a list of common passwords or a custom wordlist to attempt to gain access. The tool captures responses from the server to determine whether the login was successful or not.

### Key Components

- **HTTP Requests**: AuthCrack utilizes Python's `requests` library to handle HTTP communication.
- **Response Analysis**: The tool analyzes server responses to identify successful logins.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to manage failed requests and timeouts.

### Security Considerations

While AuthCrack is a powerful tool for ethical hacking, it is essential to use it responsibly. Always obtain permission before testing any system. Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and unethical.
